# NextAuth unstable_getServerSession Not Defined

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using NextAuth.js for server-side authentication in Next.js applications.

## Problem

The code attempts to use `unstable_getServerSession` to retrieve a user's session on the server. However, it throws an error indicating that this function is not defined.  This usually happens due to an incorrect or missing import, and can be caused by a mismatch in the NextAuth and Next.js versions, or improper configuration.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the correct import path for `getServerSession` from `next-auth/next`.  It's crucial to use the stable API instead of `unstable_getServerSession` for production deployments. This eliminates any potential issues with breaking changes in unstable APIs. Additionally, double-check the NextAuth configuration to make sure it's set up correctly and all required packages are installed.
